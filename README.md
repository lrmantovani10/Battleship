# Battleship
Repo containing a Python implementation of the famous battleship game. Although commonly played between two individuals, here the game was implemented for a single player. Files include:
* Game.py
 * The Python file contains the code for the game itself. Users flip tiles by hovering over them with their mouse for 2 seconds. They can also hover over the "quit game" button to stop playing. Every time correct shapes are revealed on the board, the user gets more points.
* Images/icon.png
 * Logo for the game simulation
* Player_Data folder
 * Folder containing CSV files that store the choices and timeframes associated with each of the player's movements. It will be generated by the Game.py file during runtime. These files are useful for analyzing player performance if desired by the user.
